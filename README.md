Typically this path is C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application

You must specify the exact folder where the browser .exe is located.
We recommend using the Chromium browser !
Here you can also change the directory where the scanned logs are saved, enable/disable proxy use, and choose whether to save cookies for YouTube separately.
Send results to Telegram has been added as a TEST! Currently, it only sends a message about the mass check's completion!



1. Unpack the archive to a convenient folder.  
2. Run the loader executable, which will launch the main application from the folder.  
3. If a link to the adapter opens in the browser, the setup worked. Wait for the loader process to finish.  
4. Enter any amount of numbers for the user ID and click the “Sign in” button.
